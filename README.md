# React-table

Table in React. I'm trying to make it without third party components in order to understand the functionality, work with array methods and abstract thinking practice.
It does not pretend to be a perfectly working table, I just add various features from real tables.

## Future improvements:

1. TypeScript migration;
2. Modal windows for detail information for each position;
3. Pagination with siblings;

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
### `npm test`
### `npm run build`
### `npm run eject`
